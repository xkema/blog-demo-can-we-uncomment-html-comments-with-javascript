This is a demo page for the blog post [Can We Uncomment HTML Comments with JavaScript?](https://xkema.github.io/2020/can-we-uncomment-html-comments-with-javascript "Can We Uncomment HTML Comments with JavaScript?")

There are two different cases under the probe. **Case 1** shows how different versions of ReactDOM update individual pieces of textual content. **Case 2** is a memory snapshot from Firefox Developer Tools to show how different numbers of DOM Nodes affect memory usage on a page.

<nav>
  <a href="./react-updates/">case 1: react-updates</a>
  <a href="./performance-optimization/">case 2: performance-optimization</a>
</nav>

## Case Outlines

At **Case 1** you'll have the same `Clock` component defined by React, with three different demarcation methods.

At **Case 2** you'll have some HTML files with including different sizes of comment nodes. See Case 2 index for the customizations.

For both demos, open up your dev tools panel and inspect the changes.
