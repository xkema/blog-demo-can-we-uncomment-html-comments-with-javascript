<p>This is a demo page for the blog post <a href="https://xkema.github.io/2020/can-we-uncomment-html-comments-with-javascript">Can We Uncomment HTML Comments with JavaScript?</a></p>
<p>There are two different cases under the probe. <b>Case 1</b> shows how different versions of ReactDOM update individual pieces of textual content. <b>Case 2</b> is a memory snapshot from Firefox Developer Tools to show how different numbers of DOM Nodes affect memory usage on a page.</p>

</nav>
<h2>Case Outlines</h2>
<p>At <b title="react-updates">Case 1</b> you'll have the same <code>Clock</code> component defined by React, with three different demarcation methods.</p>
<p>At <b title="performance-optimization">Case 2</b> you'll have some HTML files with including different sizes of comment nodes. See Case 2 index for the customizations.</p>
<p>For both demos, open up your dev tools panel and inspect the changes.</p>
